Agent Stack K8s Development
===

# Local Dependencies
Install dependencies with Homebrew via:

```bash
brew bundle
```

Run tasks via [just](https://github.com/casey/just):

```bash
just --list
```

# Integration Tests
For running the integration tests you'll need to add some additional scopes to your Buildkite API token:

- `read_artifacts`
- `read_build_logs`
- `write_pipelines`

You'll also need to create an SSH secret in your cluster to run [this test pipeline](internal/integration/fixtures/secretref.yaml). This SSH key needs to be associated with your GitHub account to be able to clone this public repo, and must be in a form acceptable to OpenSSH (aka `BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY`, not `BEGIN PRIVATE KEY`).

```bash
kubectl create secret generic agent-stack-k8s --from-file=SSH_PRIVATE_RSA_KEY=$HOME/.ssh/id_github
```

# Run from source

First store the agent token in a Kubernetes secret:

```bash!
kubectl create secret generic buildkite-agent-token --from-literal=BUILDKITE_AGENT_TOKEN=my-agent-token
```

Next start the controller:

```bash!
just run --org my-org --buildkite-token my-api-token --debug
```

## Local Deployment with Helm

`just deploy` will build the container image using [ko](https://ko.build/) and
deploy it with [Helm](https://helm.sh/).

You'll need to have set `KO_DOCKER_REPO` to a repository you have push access
to. For development something like the [kind local
registry](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/local-registry/) or the [minikube
registry](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/registry) can be used. More
information is available at [ko's
website](https://ko.build/configuration/#local-publishing-options).

You'll also need to provide required configuration values to Helm, which can be done by passing extra args to `just`:

```bash
just deploy --values config.yaml
```

With config.yaml being a file containing [required Helm values](values.yaml), such as:

```yaml
agentToken: "abcdef"
graphqlToken: "12345"
config:
  org: "my-buildkite-org"
```

The `config` key contains configuration passed directly to the binary, and so supports all the keys documented in [the example](examples/config.yaml).
